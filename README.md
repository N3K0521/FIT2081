# FIT2081 - Android Development Learning

## Overview
This repository contains some of my early Android development code, created while learning during the FIT2081 course. The code is mostly experimental, imperfect, and has quite a few bugs.

## Description
- **Language**: Early code examples are primarily written in Java/Kotlin for Android.
- **Purpose**: The main intent of this repository is to document the learning process and track progression in Android development skills.

## Note
代码较为初级，bug颇多，写得比较稀碎，主要是为了记录一些学习阶段的点滴。

## Goals
- **Record Keeping**: To preserve the learning curve and challenges faced in the early stages of Android development.
- **Progress Tracking**: To help visualize improvements and learning outcomes over time.

This repository serves as a personal diary of my Android development journey during FIT2081, showcasing both struggles and progress.
